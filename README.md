## ðŸ”— Overview

The objective of this project is to:
1. **Optimize hardware performance** and improve vehicle operations for enhanced efficiency.
2. **Develop safety mechanisms** to handle complex scenarios reliably.
3. Implement **autonomous driving capabilities**, including route planning and hazard handling.

The final goal is to deliver a fully functional autonomous vehicle system ready for demonstration at the BFMC 2025 event.
